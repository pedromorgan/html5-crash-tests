# html5-crash-tests

Can u crash html5, can u really mess things up.. prove your worth here... lets crash html5

This is repos ripped out of
- https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5
and spexcifically the test/
- https://github.com/pedromorgan/tidy-html5/tree/master/test

This means we call all fork, and just throw a good pull request..
and not to involve anything to do with upstream developers..

hopefully a good crash test we can all be dummies against.. ;-)
